# pure-python-nn
A simple fully-connected, feed-forward neural net implementation in pure Python.

Written with Branton and his Spring 18 AI class.

Notes:
  * All of this code is Python 3, not 2.
  * You can pull this repo down to your computer using git by typing at the command
    line: `git http://github.com/sj-simmons/pure-python-nn`.

    Then `cd pure-python-nn` and run programs with, for example, `python3 experiment1.py`
    (assuming that `python3` is in your `PATH`, otherwise you should be able to open, run,
    and edit the code in IDLE).
