# pure-python-nn
A simple fully-connected, feed-forward neural net implementation in pure Python.

Written with Branton and his Spring 18 AI class.

Notes:
  * All code in this repo runs in Python 3, and not necessarily in Python 2.
  * You can conveniently pull this entire repo down to your computer using git by typing at the command
    line:
    ```
    git clone http://github.com/sj-simmons/pure-python-nn
    ```
    Then enter `cd pure-python-nn` and run programs with, for example, `python3 experiment1.py`
    (assuming that `python3` is in your `PATH`; otherwise you should be able to open, run,
    and edit the code in IDLE).
